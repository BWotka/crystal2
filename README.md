# crystal README

Crystal is an updatet fork to the VSC Extension Project STONE which aims to make workflows using VSC and Microsoft OneNote easier.
It was created by copying the code from Project STONE into the new default files

## Features

Describe specific features of your extension including screenshots of your extension in action. Image paths are relative to this README file.

For example if there is an image subfolder under your extension project workspace:

\!\[feature X\]\(images/feature-x.png\)

> Tip: Many popular extensions utilize animations. This is an excellent way to show off your extension! We recommend short, focused animations that are easy to follow.

## Requirements

If you have any requirements or dependencies, add a section describing those and how to install and configure them.
